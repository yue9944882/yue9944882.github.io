Currently there&amp;rsquo;re two major approaches to monitor your operator instances &amp;ndash; metrics and logging. Metrics does well in measuring your operator in concrete numbers at runtime, and by logging you can record running details into disk files in any format. However neither of them are helpful in showing the correlation between instances/services. Distributed tracing is well-suited for microservice architectures, especially in which the services are serving in a synchronous protocol e.</description>
